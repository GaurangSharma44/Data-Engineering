Questions:

Can sample data be utilised for uploading and querying on Mongodb?

How much of the data has to be considered, one month or the entire year or for all the 10 years on NYC Trip data. - Not of entire year. The pipeline can be designed to show only one type of taxi.

It is okay not to use docker since it consumes a lot of system resources. Also, kafka is not required since it is static data that is being used for the project.

when is the busiest time of the taxi trips. what is the busiest day of the week.
